            <h2>We Are the Guard</h2>
            <img src="img/watg.png" alt="We Are the Guard cover art" width="200" height="200">
            <p>“We Are the Guard” is a patriotic song that tells the story of the National Guard — who we are and what we stand for. For more than 300 years, the Guard has been America’s first military force, born from the early citizen militias that protected their colonies long before our nation was formed.

            <img src="img/shadow.png" alt="A Shadow Falls cover art" width="200" height="200">
            <p>“A Shadow Falls” tells the story of a wounded soldier lying on the battlefield in his final moments, reflecting on his life and regrets. It’s a tribute to those whose lives ended too soon, before they had the chance to make the mark they dreamed of.</p>

            <img src="img/autobot.png" alt="Transformers Not the Autobots cover art" width="200" height="200">
