      <h2>Top 5 Songs I've Written</h2>
      <p>
        As a songwriter, music has always been my way of expressing emotions,
        telling stories, and connecting with others. Over the years, I've penned
        numerous songs across various genres, each holding a special place in my
        heart. Here are the top five songs I've written that stand out for their
        personal significance, lyrical depth, and musicality.

                />
                <p>
                  “We Are the Guard” is a patriotic song that tells the story of
                  the National Guard — who we are and what we stand for. For
                  more than 300 years, the Guard has been America’s first
                  military force, born from the early citizen militias that
                  protected their colonies long before our nation was formed.
                  This song captures that spirit — duty, pride, and the enduring
                  truth that the National Guard is always there when America
                  calls.

                />
                <p>
                  “A Shadow Falls” tells the story of a wounded soldier lying on
                  the battlefield in his final moments, reflecting on his life
                  and regrets. It’s a tribute to those whose lives ended too
                  soon, before they had the chance to make the mark they dreamed
                  of.

                <p>
                  “Transformers: Not the Autobots You’re Looking For” is a fun
                  educational song that uses pop culture to explain artificial
                  intelligence. It draws a clever parallel between classic
                  Transformers and modern AI models like GPT, making the topic
                  engaging and easy to understand.

                  This song tells the story of my youthful years — chasing
                  adventure with my first car and later transitioning into
                  adulthood. It's a nostalgic ride through memory lane and the
                  lessons I learned along the way.
