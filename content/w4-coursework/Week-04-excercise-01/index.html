    <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
    <p>
      I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a website.
      Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits only appeared on my
      computer and did not affect the actual website.
    </p>

    <div class="screenshot-container">
      <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
    </div>

    <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>I changed the H2 exercise alignment from:</strong><br>
        &lt;h2 style="color: #ffffff; background: #000000;
        border-left: 15px solid #E90802; padding: 10px;"&gt;

        <h2 style="color: #ffffff; background: #000000; border-left: 15px solid #E90802; padding: 10px;">

        &lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        <h2>Which Subsequently Rendered:</h2>
        <h2 style="color: #e7d90f; background: #e90802; border-left: 15px solid #000000; padding: 0110px;">

        </h2>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>For the CSS:</strong> I changed the following element styles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text color to: color: #e7d90f; Yellow</li>
          <li>Background to: #e90802; Red</li>
          <li>Border-left to: 15px solid #000000; Black</li>
          <li>Padding: 0110px;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Since it is on the internet, it must be true? Therefore, I expect my grades to be adjusted immediately 😎
      </li>

      <li>
        I originally was going to change my bank statement, but it is all injected via React. Therefore, I could not
        figure out how to change anything on the page through DevTools, so I chose something easier (the TTU website).
      </li>

      <ul>
        <li>On TTU, the HTML and inline CSS could be easily manipulated, and I could see my changes immediately.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>
        It was easy to see the style attributes and know immediately what should change. I did have a little
        trouble at first figuring out which parts were what, but experimentation quickly answered my questions.
      </li>

      <li>
        I have been watching a lot of videos on the internet, and I think I am going to open a call center to get some
        gift cards. 🦹‍♂️💰 (JK)
