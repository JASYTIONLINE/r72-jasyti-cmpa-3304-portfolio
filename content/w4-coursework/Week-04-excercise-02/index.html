      <!-- Introduction Paragraph-->
      <p>
        Kuk Sool Won is considered the Official Martial Art of Korea. The Korean
        word "KuK" directley translates to "NATION" but it is understood to mean
        "Korea" as well. "Sool" is "Technique." "WON" is "association."
        Therefore, KUK Sool Won translates into the Korean National Martial Arts
        Association.

          <p class="description">
            In my life, the most influential people I have ever met are my
            Martial Arts instructors. They have taught me discipline, respect,
            and confidence. The gentleman in gold is 9th Dan Barry Harmon, and
            he was my first instructor over 40 years ago. The man on the left is
            6th Dan Raul Sosa — Master Sosa is my current instructor. The man on
            my right is 7th Dan Master Jolly, a retired Air Force Chief Master
            Sergeant who taught me for two years after I rejoined KSW in 2019.
            The other man on my right is 7th Dan Joe Foster; he and I started
            training together in the 1980s. All of these men have had a huge
            impact on my life.

          <p class="description">
            Kuk Sool Won is a comprehensive system that includes striking, joint
            locks, throws, weapons, meditation, and healing techniques. It is a
            complete martial art that integrates both hard and soft styles,
            offering a balanced approach to training and self-defense. Here we
            see many of the different aspects of KSW.

          <p class="details">Stance | 2024 | Offensive Guard</p>
          <p class="description">
            This stance may not look as impressive, but it is an important
            position in Kuk Sool Won. It is used for both offense and defense.
            From this position, you can quickly transition to other stances and
            techniques. It is not really considered a fighting stance but more
            of a ready position. In practice, we go low and wide to develop
            strength and stability. In real-world situations, we would stand
            more upright and relaxed, with the hands in a neutral, un-tensed
            position. This stance is not meant to signal aggression but rather
            to prepare for action if needed.

          <h2>The Basic Front Kick</h2>
          <p class="details">Technique | 2025 | Front Kick</p>
          <p class="description">
            Not bad for an old man! The front kick is one of the most
            fundamental techniques in Kuk Sool Won. It is used for both offense
            and defense. The kick is performed by lifting the knee and extending
            the leg forward to strike with the ball of the foot. It is a
            powerful technique that can target an opponent's midsection or head.
            The front kick is also useful for creating distance between you and
            your opponent, allowing you to set up other techniques. It is one of
            the fastest kicks in Kuk Sool Won, making it an effective tool for
            self-defense.

          <h2>The Basic Side Kick</h2>
          <p class="details">Technique | 2025 | Side Kick</p>
          <p class="description">
            The hips aren't what they used to be! Side kicks are a powerful
            technique in Kuk Sool Won. They are performed by lifting the knee
            and extending the leg to the side, striking with the heel or the
            edge of the foot. Side kicks are most effective for striking an
            opponent who is not directly in front of you. Side kicks require
            good balance and flexibility, making them a challenging technique to
            master. However, with practice they become a powerful tool for
            self-defense. It is not necessary to chamber the kick as high as you
            can; effective strikes can target the knee or ankle to disable an
            opponent, and these kicks can be used by elderly or mobility-limited
            practitioners.

          <h2>Korean Straight Sword</h2>
          <p class="details">Weapons | 2025 | Geom-Straight Sword</p>
          <p class="description">
            The Korean Straight Sword, also known as the "Geom," is a
            traditional weapon used in Kuk Sool Won. It is characterized by its
            straight, single or double-edged blade and is often used in forms
            and demonstrations. The sword techniques in Kuk Sool Won emphasize
            fluidity, precision, and control, making it a beautiful and
            effective weapon in martial arts practice. Fun Fact: I made this
            Sword 40 years ago. <em>It's Sharp!</em>
