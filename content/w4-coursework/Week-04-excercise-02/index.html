        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
    
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" png />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
             <ul>
            <li><strong>I changed the H2 excercise alignment from: <br>

                &lt;/h2&gt;""
                <h2>Which Subsequently Rendered: </h2>
            </li>

            <h2 style="color: #e7d90f;background: #e90802;border-left: 15px solid #000000;padding: 0110px;">Week 04
                Exercise 01 - Mr. Barkle Gets an Automatic A in this class</h2>
           
            <li><p><strong>For the CSS:</strong> I changed the following element styles:</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Text color to :color: #e7d90f; Yellow</li>
              <li> Background to: #e90802; RED.</li> 
              <li>  Border-left to: 15px solid #000000;Black</li> 
                <li>padding: 0110px;</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Since it is on the internet, it must be true? Therefore I expect my grades to be adjusted immediatly 😎
            </li>
            <li>I origionally was going to chang my bank statment but it is all injected via React. Therefore I could
                not ifgure outhow to change anyting on the page through dev tools so I chose something easier (The TTU
                Web Site)</li>
            <ul>I was not able to effect the DOM on the bank ing sight so I chose a less secure sight that had obvious
                HTML and inline CSS so I could easily manipulate it and see my changed immediatly</ul>
            <li>Yes it was easy to see the Style attributes and know immediatley what should change. I did have a littel
                trouble at first figuring out which parts were what, but experimentation quickly answered my questions.
            </li>
            <li>I have been watching a lot of videos on the internet and I think I am going to open a call center to get some gift cards.🦹‍♂️💰 (JK)</li>
