CMPA 3304 â€” Content Redirect Page
This page exists only as a safety redirect. If a user manually enters or
navigates to the /content/ directory, it automatically sends them back to the
main homepage at the root of the portfolio. There is no styling beyond default
HTML behavior for speed and reliability.
