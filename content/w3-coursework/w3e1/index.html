        <p> My name is John Barkle, and I am 55 years old and recently started a year long sabatical from work to go
          back to school and finish a degree in CMPA, as well as get traineid in Full Stack Engenering. My goal after I
          finish all this training is to sequey into AI application development and Full Stack engeeering.I’m currently
          studying web design. This card demonstrates how the CSS box model uses padding, borders, and margins to
          control spacing and layout. </p>
        <p>
          This card demonstrates how the CSS box model defines space around
          elements. The flexbox is styled by refernceing style.css in my assets/css folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am using a &lt;DIV&gt; as a last resort protocol. Meaning I am seeking to use descriptive semantic tags such
          as
          &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;header&gt; to provide clear structure and act as a visual and
          cognitive signifiers for both
          developers and users. Threrefore, the &lt;div&gt; tag is reserved for situations with no semantic alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use long format Paragraph-style comments throughout this file explain intent rather
          than isolated commands. This documentation supports long-term maintainability, instructional clarity, and
          portfolio review. I use it to help me remember what I did and why the next time I look back at this file.
