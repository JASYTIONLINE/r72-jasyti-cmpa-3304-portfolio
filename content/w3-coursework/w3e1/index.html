  <h1>Week 03 Exercise 01 — Box Model Practice</h1>
  The main element contains the primary content of the page. It is used here
  to hold a single article that demonstrates the box model in a self-contained
  way, making it easy to study or grade.
  -->
  <main>
    <!--
    The article represents a standalone block of content — in this case, the
    personal card. It replaces a generic div so the HTML reflects intent and
    keeps "div as last resort" discipline. The class name is used for styling.
    -->
    <article class="card">
      <!--
      The header inside this article introduces the content that follows. It
      contains the subject's name, styled later in CSS to create hierarchy and
      visible spacing using margin and font size rather than empty divs.
      -->
      <header class="card-header">
        <h2>John Barkle</h2>
      </header>

      <!--
      This section holds the descriptive text. Grouping it semantically clarifies
      that this paragraph belongs to the card and not the page at large. Its
      padding, margin, and border relationships will show how the box model works.
      -->
      <section class="card-bio">
        <p>
          This card demonstrates the CSS box model by using padding, borders,
          and margins to create space around the content. The box model is a core
          concept in web design that defines how elements are sized and spaced.
          I use a &lt;div&gt; as a last resort, preferring semantic HTML5 elements like
          &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;header&gt; to give meaning to the structure of
          the page. If you notice somewhere I used the &lt;div&gt; tag and could have used
          a more appropriate tag, your feedback is welcome.</p>
        <p>
          If you look at my code, you will notice I use paragraph style comments so I can come back later and study my
          work and remebner why I did things a certain way.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!--
      The footer closes the article and provides a place for secondary details
      like a course label or attribution. It maintains semantic completeness
      and consistent sectioning within the page.
