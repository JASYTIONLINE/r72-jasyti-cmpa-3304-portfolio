This document demonstrates the CSS box model for Week 03 Exercise 01.
It is built to professional standards using relative links so it will
publish cleanly to GitHub Pages. The comments explain why each element
exists and how it contributes to predictable, maintainable layout.  I use paragraph style comments so I can come back later and study my work and remebner why I did things a certain way.

      The header inside this article introduces the content that follows. It
      contains the subject's name, styled later in CSS to create hierarchy and
      visible spacing using margin and font size rather than empty divs.

      This section holds the descriptive text. Grouping it semantically clarifies
      that this paragraph belongs to the card and not the page at large. Its
      padding, margin, and border relationships will show how the box model works.

        <p>
          This card demonstrates the CSS box model by using padding, borders,
          and margins to create space around the content. The box model is a core
          concept in web design that defines how elements are sized and spaced.
          I use a &lt;div&gt; as a last resort, preferring semantic HTML5 elements like
          &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;header&gt; to give meaning to the structure of
          the page. If you notice somewhere I used the &lt;div&gt; tag and could have used
          a more appropriate tag, your feedback is welcome.</p>
        <p>
          If you look at my code, you will notice I use paragraph style comments so I can come back later and study my
          work and remebner why I did things a certain way.
