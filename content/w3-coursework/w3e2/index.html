Week 03 Exercise 02 — Flexbox Froggy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is part of the CMPA 3304 coursework portfolio. It demonstrates
how to embed an image of the completed Flexbox Froggy exercise using purely
semantic HTML and an external CSS stylesheet. Every element is commented
in detail to explain its role in the structure, layout, and teaching value
of the page.
-->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!--
  The <meta> elements below ensure the page renders consistently across devices
  and maintains accessibility standards. The charset is set to UTF-8 to allow
  proper encoding of text characters. The viewport tag ensures that scaling and
  layout adapt automatically for mobile screens and smaller viewports. These
  two elements are fundamental for responsive web design and must appear in
  every HTML document that is intended for public viewing.
  -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

    <!--
  The <title> tag defines what will appear in the browser tab and also serves
  as the title used by search engines when the site is indexed. Including both
  the course and exercise name maintains clarity and continuity for readers
  navigating the broader project repository.

    <!--
  This line links the external stylesheet responsible for all visual presentation.
  Using a relative path allows the page to function both locally and when deployed
  to GitHub Pages. No styling is embedded here because we maintain strict
  separation of concerns: HTML handles structure and meaning, while CSS handles
  presentation. To understand how specific elements are styled, open the CSS file
  located at "../assets/css/style.css". Look for the class named “.screenshot”
  inside that file to see how images like the one below are centered and scaled
  consistently across the entire website.
  -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../assets/css/style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <!--
  The <header> section provides the topmost identifier for this page. It contains
  the level-one heading (<h1>) that introduces the topic. Using <header> rather
  than a generic <div> adds semantic meaning, signaling to browsers and screen
  readers that this block defines the page’s introductory content.
  -->
    <header>
      <h1>Week 03 Exercise 02: Flexbox Froggy</h1>
    </header>
  <header class="header">
      <div class="navbar">

    <!--
  The <main> element encloses all primary content unique to this page. It ensures
  that assistive technologies can quickly identify where the central instructional
  material begins, separate from navigation or footer information.
  -->
    <main>
      <!--
    The <figure> element groups the image (<img>) with its descriptive caption
    (<figcaption>). This combination ensures semantic clarity—indicating that
    the two pieces of content are related. The figure is assigned a class named
    “screenshot.” We use this class so that all screenshots throughout the
    course portfolio can share a consistent style. By applying the same class
    name everywhere, we can make a single change in the stylesheet to update
    alignment, borders, or scaling for every screenshot site-wide.

    To locate the styling for this class, open the external CSS file referenced
    above and search for ".screenshot". The comments there explain how the class
    uses Flexbox to center the figure, how it limits image width for responsive
    design, and how it provides padding and border details that match the site’s
    overall color palette.
    -->
      <figure class="screenshot">
        <!--
      The <img> tag below embeds the PNG screenshot that documents the completed
      Flexbox Froggy exercise. The “src” attribute provides a relative path to the image file stored in this folder’s assets/images subdirectory. Because this path is relative, it will work correctly both in local previews and when hosted on GitHub Pages.

      The “alt” attribute supplies descriptive text for accessibility readers and also serves as fallback text if the image fails to load. It is important that the alt text be meaningful and specific enough to describe what the screenshot depicts, not just the filename.
      -->
        <img
          src="assets/images/w3e2-flexbox-froggy-solved.png"
          alt="Screenshot showing the completed Flexbox Froggy exercise, demonstrating alignment and order concepts."
        />

        <!--
      The <figcaption> tag provides a brief textual explanation beneath the screenshot. It clarifies what the image represents within the context of the course. Including captions helps reinforce visual-verbal learning by connecting the image to its educational purpose. This also improves SEO because search engines recognize the semantic link between the image and
      its captioned description.

  The <footer> section concludes the page and provides global attribution. Using
  a footer ensures the information stays visually and structurally separated from
  main content. Here we display the course week and number as part of the ongoing
  documentation pattern followed throughout the portfolio. Future enhancements,
  such as navigation links or contact details, could also be placed here.
