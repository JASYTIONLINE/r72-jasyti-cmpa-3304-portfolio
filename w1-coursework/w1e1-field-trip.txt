I chose: https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/pepsi-1996.

The 1996 Pepsi site looks exciting but struggles with mapping and affordability. The layout is visually dense, which makes it hard to understand what the site is trying to accomplish or what I should do once I arrive. The "Enter" button is present but not mapped in a way that draws the userâ€™s attention, and the overall design feels more like a TV promotion than a product site. The result is an experience that looks fun but lacks clarity and purpose.
