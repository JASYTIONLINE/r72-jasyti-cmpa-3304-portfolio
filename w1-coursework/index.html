        <h2>Week 01 Exercise 02: Field Trip to the Web Design Museum</h2>
        <p>For my web site to analyse I chose a <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/pepsi-1996"> 1996
                Pepsi</a> site which looks exciting but struggles with mapping and affordability. The layout is visually
            dense, which makes it hard to understand what the site is trying to accomplish or what I should do once I
            arrive. The "Enter" button is present but not mapped in a way that draws the user’s attention, and the
            overall design feels more like a TV promotion than a product site. The result is an experience that looks
            fun but lacks clarity and purpose.</p>
